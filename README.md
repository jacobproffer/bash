# Bash Rename Scripts

Collection of bash scripts for organizing files and folders.

- **rename_underscores_to_dashes**: Converts underscores (\_) to dashes (-) in folder names recursively.
- **rename_files_structured**: Renames image files based on EXIF DateTimeOriginal (or fallback file date), with optional topic and camera name, keeping separate sequences per file type.
- **undo_rename**: Reverts the file renames using the log generated by `rename_files_structured`.

## Prerequisites

- macOS with Bash 3.x or newer (Bash 5+ recommended for `rename_files_structured`)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install a modern Bash version if needed
- `exiftool` installed for reading photo metadata:

```bash
brew install exiftool
```
